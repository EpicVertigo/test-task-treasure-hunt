# Test Task: Treasure Hunt

- [Requirements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dxYYgBhE8i_HkK_2UDddnteZXQjq1O7F/view)

The goal of this task is to implement two different solutions for solving "treasure map" matrices.
`implementation_1.py` contains object-oriented solution and `implementation_2.py` contains functional-based solution with recursion. Both implementations are reading and solving map in `treasure_map.json` file. 

## Running Tests

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest --cov=.
